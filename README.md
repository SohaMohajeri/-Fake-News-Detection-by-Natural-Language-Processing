Fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media. This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas. Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viralized by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble.

This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news, based on the text of the news articles, regardless of their titles. Using sklearn, we will build three models on our dataset to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE. For this purpose, we will build three different models including Random Forest, Naive-Bayes and passive Agressive Classifiers and fit the models and use them with and without text preprocessing and with only removing the stop words. Ultimately, the accuracy scores and the confusion matrices will tell us how well our models perform.
